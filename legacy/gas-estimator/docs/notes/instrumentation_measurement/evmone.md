## Evmone

### Installation and running

1. Building

    ```
    mkdir build
    git submodule update --init
    cd build
    cmake .. -DEVMONE_TESTING=ON
    cmake --build . -- -j $(nproc)
    ```

    Changes related to the Gas Cost Estimator are in branch `wallclock` in both `evmone` and `evmc` git submodules.

    I got compile errors because of old gcc not supporting C++17

    1. https://askubuntu.com/questions/466651/how-do-i-use-the-latest-gcc-on-ubuntu/1163021#1163021
    2. then:

    ```
    sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/gcc gcc /usr/bin/gcc-8 10
    sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/g++ g++ /usr/bin/g++-8 10
    ```

2. Running

    From the `build` directory:

    ```
    evmc/bin/evmc run --vm ./lib/libevmone.so [--print-opcodes] [--measure-all] [--measure-total] [--measure-one <instruction number>] [--repeat <number of repetitions>] <bytecode>
    ```

    for example:

    ```
    evmc/bin/evmc run --vm ./lib/libevmone.so --print-opcodes --measure-all --measure-one 3 --repeat 2 602060070260F053600160F0F3
    ```

    To measure timer overheads:

    ```
    evmc/bin/evmc measure-overheads
    ```

### Comments

-   evmone adds `5B` (`JUMPDEST`) instruction in the beginning if there is none

### Rough notes

1. ~Probably not a good fit to meausure, only instrumentation~ EDIT: we'll measure it
2. EVMC API - these are tools that go with the EVMONE VM implementation.
    1. under `/build/evmc/bin/evmc run --help` one finds help about how to run bytecode
    2. trying `evmc/bin/evmc run 0x60` - this is `PUSH1`, check out https://www.ethervm.io/#60
        1. PUSH 20
        2. PUSH 07
        3. MUL
        4. PUSH F0 (offset)
        5. MSTORE8
        6. PUSH 01 (length)
        7. PUSH F0 (offset)
        8. RETURN
        9. `evmc/bin/evmc run --vm ./lib/libevmone.so 602060070260F053600160F0F3`, nice

### Notes on execution

1. `auto analysis = analyze(rev, code, code_size);` before execution does some preallocations and preprocessing based on static code information, like assembling information about code blocks - I think it's still "fair", but might definitely cause uneven "gas dynamics" if compared to simple interpreters
    - **BUT** - some operations are done per-block, e.g. _static_ gas operations and checks etc. This isn't very fair, it will fatten the perceived cost of
2. The `JUMPDEST` which appears at the beginning of each program is an intrinsic opcode `BEGINBLOCK`, `evmone` specific
    - "These intrinsic instructions may be injected to the code in the analysis phase"
    - "This instruction is defined as alias for JUMPDEST and replaces all JUMPDEST instructions"
