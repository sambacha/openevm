1. The approach to measure instructions is not final. Measuring whole programs is still on the list. Measuring whole programs introduces a lot of burden on the analysis stage.
2. PD plan for today: cleanup scripts, (optional) analyze first results in R, search for prior art on VM instrumentation & analysis.
3. MS plan for today: cleanup evmone instrumentation, standardize outputs
4. MS 50% time, PD 20% time, aiming for II half of Jan to have the Stage I report.
5. Consider measuring only `operation.execute` in `geth`, to fully match instrumentation adopted for `evmone`. For now, both instrumentations measure "the entire interpreter loop", if we neglect the `while(instr is nullptr)` in `evmone`, so measurements are quite compatible.
6. Need to be mindful about how we want to measure the EVMs and how they are initialized and what do they do in their interpreter loop. Make notes about geth/evmone/openethereum for now, we'll work on making measurements 100% compatible later.

### Action items

1. PD to check ethereum magicians and eth research for prior art
