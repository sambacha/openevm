Welcome to the `evm_llvm` wiki! This project aims at bringing LLVM infrastructure to the EVM world where smart contracts are widely deployed.

EVM LLVM is an EVM architecture backend for LLVM. With EVM LLVM you can generate EVM binary code with LLVM-based compilers. The backend does not assume a language frontend, so you should be able to plug in a new smart contract language frontend to generate EVM binary.

The goal of this project is to make it able to for various of platforms, tools and smart contract programming language projects be able to quickly adapt a high-performance EVM backend.
