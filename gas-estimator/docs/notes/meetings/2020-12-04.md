1. turbo geth / silkworm / evmone https://ledgerwatch.github.io/turbo_geth_release.html#Integration-with-evmone-via-EVMC - evmone as first-class citizen EVM to measure
2. PD: opbench.md and timing_of_jvm_instructions.md, monotonic clocks, nanosecond precision
3. 0xfe - invalid opcode, let's keep measuring as we do now, but we'll need to revisit. Same JUMP JUMPI
4. PD, RZ: let's push notes to repo, even messy
5. PD less available this week
6. MS: evmone has +1 instruction vs geth - to investigate
7. MS to push/PR to .py scripts as needed
8. MS: geth measurements much slower than evmone, and than geth for PD - to investigate
9. Plan MS: wrapup evmone, send csv to PD (or run R), openethereum/rust ramp up
10. Plan PD: papers, nanosecond measurements investigation, other measurements for comparison (?)
