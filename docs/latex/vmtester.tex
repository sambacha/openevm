 The EVMC project contains a EVMC-\/compatibility testing tool for VM implementations.

The tool is called {\ttfamily evmc-\/vmtester} and to include it in the EVMC build add {\ttfamily -\/DEVMC\+\_\+\+TESTING=ON} CMake option to the project configuration step.

Usage is simple as


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{evmc-\/vmtester [vm]}

\end{DoxyCode}


where {\ttfamily \mbox{[}vm\mbox{]}} is a path to a shared library with VM implementation.
