1. Let's do notes from everything
2. GH project + 1-2 day effort tickets. Cut whenever task extends. Goal: know what we're doing and identify blockers
3. Choose boring tech
4. How public?
  - post on ethresearch
    - final - yes
    - initial - not this week, but when we ramp
  - how do we describe funding/association?
5. Define and document API's on the 3 domains
  - instrumentation & measurement
  - sample programs
  - model
6. Gather prior docs/materials
  - RZ will send
  - Radek to send if there has been an anouncement of our project
7. Ideas how to generate sample programs:
  - random, genetic to optimize throughput
  - chfast has a measurement tool for geth (EVM)
  - we measure
  - we model and find gas coefficients for operations
  - watch for coefficients prone to attacks
  - chfast suggests arithmetics are overpriced. This is an issue given current pressure for statelessness
  - let's be flexible
8. Do a kick-off call with chfast and Marcin Benke
  - Radek to let them know
9. 15-min sync up. 10.00am on Fridays
  - Piotr to invity
10. use Hangouts, make a group
11. Radek to introduce to Jake Hudson from EF
