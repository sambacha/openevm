1. PD: importance of measuring and controlling time measurement, see: [here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/imapp-pl/gas-cost-estimator/blob/master/src/analysis/exploration_timers.nb.html) for details
2. PD: per-instruction timing would be very good for (3.)
3. PD: algorithmic generation of most-informative (e.g. highest variance) sets of programs
4. We'll discuss this with MB & PB next week if possible
5. MS: we're measuring OpenEthereum instructions, need to do repetition and parameters and output standarization. We'll try to have a csv result to compare td/tmr, for PD to run comparison on (with geth & evmone). Will keep us posted
6. MS: hurdle with Rust - very slow compilation, looks like a common Rust issue?
