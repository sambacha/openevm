1. PD: pls feedback on strategy.md early PR
2. tentatively meet with MB & PB in 2 weeks
3. scope of stage 1: proposing iterative approach on program generation + spike to explore 1st iterations
    PD proposition:
      - iteration 0 - simplest program to run single OPCODE
      - iteration 1 - expand to capture impact of input values
      - iteration 2 - expand to capture impact of "surrounding execution"
      - etc.
4. how far to pursue instrumentation & measurement?
    - baseline - wallclock time
    - other measurements on top of that, but what about portability across implementations?
    - try to allow for convenient execution of various measurements
    - allow for repetition
    - evmone is our "3rd choice" EVM implementation, could be useful for reference/comparison

### Action items

- PD to ask PB about geth flag to measure overhead
- MS to focus on evmone instrumentation&measurement spike first, next OpenEthereum instrumentation&measurement spike
- PD to focus on geth instrumentation&measurement spike, if done spike program generation
