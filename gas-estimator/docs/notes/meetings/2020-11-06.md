1. measure instruction resource use in isolation or by measuring indirectly (measuring entire program run)?
    - insert measurement into the interpreter loop - feasible. Do not write down instructions, do it separately - once for measurement, second for opcodes for minimal
    - measure entire time for verification
    - feasible as plan A
    - sampling and batch measurement as plan B/follow-up/verification
6. MB: define our value added. RZ: this is exploratory phase, we propose a set of methods
    - our focus different than Broken Metre - want to propose a consistent tool for gas pricing
    - Stage I should allow to build out the necessary tooling
    - Stage I - hacky implementations to test out feasibility are within scope
7. which resources are we focusing on: clock time only or RAM footprint as well.
    - RAM-gas-pricing - cost for RAM rises quadratically - so this is not a first-priority
    - PB to read on the takeways from Broken Metre RAM-gas correlation
    - Let's focus on CPU-intensity / execution time
8. is CALLDATACOPY an IO operation? we have it in our list but Broken Metre tells us it is IO (should we take out IO-operations?)
    -  CALLDATACOPY - should not be considered IO, might be side effect of particular implementation
    - something to be careful about
9. evmone instrumentation - there is just a general idea how to do this, no ready tool yet. PB to let know where to start
10. fork repos to `imapp-pl`
