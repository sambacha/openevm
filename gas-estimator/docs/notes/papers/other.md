## Other resources which might be useful

1. Ethereum yellow paper - worth a quick scan, holds an (up-to-date?) list of opcodes in EVM with descriptions and details
2. https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/evm/ - just basics to ramp up with
3. https://www.ethervm.io/ - reference for EVM opcodes + Decompiler
4. https://medium.com/swlh/getting-deep-into-evm-how-ethereum-works-backstage-ab6ad9c0d0bf - nice intro for a broader perspective how EVM works
5. https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1m89CVujrQe5LAFJ8-YAUCcNK950dUzMQPMJBxRtGCqs/edit#gid=0 - "1.0 gas costs" spreadsheet - ilustrates the original calculations to get gas costs. Seems to work like this:
    - calculate how much effort can a single block be (e.g. take x time max, leave y memory footprint, take z storage for block history etc.) - see cells L5-L10. Call this _block effort_limit_
    - set an arbitrary _block gas limit_
    - express the cost of a unit this effort (e.g. a microsecond of computation) in gas using the block gas limit and block effort limit
    - measure footprint of each opcode (how?) in these dimensions - see columns B-G
    - express this footprint in gas - see column H
6. https://github.com/wolflo/evm-opcodes - source for `www.ethervm.io`, but with a nice compilation of gas cost formulas from the yellow paper. Not exactly sure about up-to-dateness, e.g. it mentions 700 for STATICCALL, while other sources 40 (after EIP-2046)
7. https://dave.cheney.net/high-performance-go-workshop/dotgo-paris.html - some materials on go profiling and benchmarks. Not immediately useful but:
    - tips on profiling with garbage collector
    - compiler optimization traps
    - avoiding appending (**TODO** ensure we don't)
1. https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-150 - new gas costs there calculated along the lines of the original model - good to cite for motivations of gas research. Only IO intensive
8. https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1884 - good to cite for motivations of gas research. Measurements were done on chain history, via ms/MGas metric. Only IO intensive
    - **TODO** - gather and write down rationale towards focusing on non-IO operations


## Other resources scanned, which aren't relevant to us

1. http://bergel.eu/MyPapers/Soto20a-FuzzingSolidity.pdf - "Fuzzing to Estimate Gas Costs of Ethereum Contracts" - irrelevant; is about comparing Solidity static gas cost estimation and estimation using fuzzing testing.
1. The `evmjit` story (which I stumbled upon [here](https://ethresear.ch/t/evm-performance/2791))- the idea seemed to be to replace patterns of operations with "bulk" operations, e.g. a bunch of static PUSH instructions before a `CALL` to become a single meta-instruction. _It would be of great significance_ to our results, but seems to be discontinued (in `geth` codebase there's no occurrences, similar for `OpenEthereum`, [this is not active](https://github.com/ethereum/evmjit) and then [this](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/issues/2365#issuecomment-275493369)).
